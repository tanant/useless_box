Todo:

need to generate some ways of creating the program - but the timings are all voltage/etc dependent (apart from the base program)





next challenge - set up the program/driver structure. THe sleep timings and concept works nicely.

on the concept of bounces - what happens if you have a bad bounce? you still need to do debouncing, fool. 
consider if you flip the main switch, and it twiddles 50 times, you will get 50 state changes.

Fool.

Drop your OCRA and do better debounces. No debounce necessary for the interrupt switch as long as you have proper debounce on the rest (CPU wake and all)





might need to rethink any of the input read systems.. we could fire up TCCNT0?

A button read needs to be significantly faster than anything else out there.. oh, so we have a TCCNT0 which is just doing button polls and shoves the result in portXYZ state
